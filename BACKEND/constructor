A constructor in Java is a special method used to initialize objects of a class. Itâ€™s called when an object of the class is created and can be used to set initial values for object attributes.

Here are a few key points:

Same Name as Class: The constructor has the same name as the class.

No Return Type: Constructors do not have a return type, not even void.

Automatic Call: It gets called automatically when an object is created.

Types of Constructors:

Default Constructor: No parameters.

Parameterized Constructor: Takes arguments to initialize attributes.

Example:

java
Copy
Edit
public class Car {
    String model;
    int year;

    // Default constructor
    public Car() {
        model = "Unknown";
        year = 0;
    }

    // Parameterized constructor
    public Car(String model, int year) {
        this.model = model;
        this.year = year;
    }

    public void display() {
        System.out.println("Model: " + model + ", Year: " + year);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Car car1 = new Car();  // Calls default constructor
        Car car2 = new Car("Tesla", 2023);  // Calls parameterized constructor
        car1.display();
        car2.display();
    }
}
